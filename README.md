# CPP_Projects-00---04-
This would be the place where my learnings of Cpp will be stored, and this reposetory would  consist of the milestone 4 cpp projects.


[ ~CPP_Module_00~ ]

1). Megaphone :
    -> Learned how to include the C++ Standard Input/output stream for 
       printing stuff. (No more printf and hello std::cout!!!)
    -> Usage of the operator 
        ( << ).  Used for printing..
        ( std::endl ). Used for newline and even acts like a free memory.
        ( std::toupper() ). Used for the transformation of characters.
        ( For ). Used as a nested loop, [bye bye while loops...]
    -> Compiling using -std=c++98.
