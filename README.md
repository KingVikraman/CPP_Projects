# CPP_Projects-00---04-
This would be the place where my learnings of Cpp will be stored, and this reposetory would  consist of the milestone 4 cpp projects.


[ ~CPP_Module_00~ ]

1). Megaphone :
    -> Learned how to include the C++ Standard Input/output stream for 
       printing stuff. (No more printf and hello std::cout!!!)
    -> Usage of the operator 
        ( << ).  Used for printing..
        ( std::endl ). Used for newline and even acts like a free memory.
        ( std::toupper() ). Used for the transformation of characters.
        ( For ). Used as a nested loop, [bye bye while loops...]
    -> Compiling using -std=c++98.

2). Phonebook :
    -> Learned about Classes and Objects, what classes are,
        how to create objects from it, and that each object
        holds its own data.
    -> Also, learned about private and public access specifiers
        . How the use of private data allows to protect the value 
        within each variable. If it is private, it is only accessible
        inside its own class, whereas if public means accessible from
        outside the class.
        In a nutshell this is called, [ Encapsulation ]. Locking the 
        variables in a vault.
    -> Learned about the .hpp and .cpp file seperation, by splitting the
        declatration and definition.
    -> Usage of the std::string and std::getline which is techically the
        replacement of char[]. makes string manipulation way easier.
    -> Object Arrays and fixed size logic. Where i built an array of 8 
        contact objects, and learned to store multiple objects and track
        their positions with an index (and overwite the oldest if the  limit is hit).
    -> Got to know how to create two classes and build relations between \
        classess and use one inside another.
    -> Input Validation & index selectionm how to validate user input in cpp,
        and prevent crashing on bad entries.
